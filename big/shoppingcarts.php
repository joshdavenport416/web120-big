    <p>Taking the cyber-step into ecommerce with your business means more than simply creating Instagram and Facebook accounts. For any web presence to pay off, you’re going to need to offer your potential new customers an easy way to purchase your goods and services while working at their office computer, laying in bed with their laptop, or killing time on the porcelain throne. Enter the virtual shopping cart.</p>
    <p>We’ve all used them. Shopping for our kids’ birthday presents on amazon, ordering mom flowers from flowers.com, or salivating over the menu on the Domino's mobile app. When we get to the point where we’re ready to start selling our products online, we need to choose whether we want to use a hosted or a licensed shopping cart. “So, what’s the difference?” you ask.</p>
    <p>In a hosted shopping cart a third-party firm "hosts" the solution and is responsible for server backups, maintenance and upgrades. The beauty of a hosted solution is that hosting comes free, which means it doesn't cost anything for the third party to keep your site functional on the Web. The main drawback with hosted solutions is that customers will be directed to another domain for payment processing.</p>
    <p>A licensed shopping cart allows business owners to build their own type of cart and customize it to their specific needs. There is much greater flexibility in changing features and functionality, as well as in adding third-party tools if need be. However, the upfront costs are often higher and require more hands-on expertise for troubleshooting issues and technical support. Andre Minalto of andrewminalto.com says “In a word – you’ll face more technical problems when using your own hosting account, that’s something I can guarantee you (Minalto)”</p>
    <p>In the end, choosing between a hosted or licensed shopping cart comes down to weighing expense with flexibility. Hosted carts require less work and maintenance at an overall cheaper cost, where licensed carts offer more creative freedom with a greater expense. “There is no one correct or right option between hosted shopping carts and licensed ones, but the points mentioned in this article will be able to help you in terms of figuring out the suitable solution for you. (Khanna)”.</p>
