    <h1>Responsive Websites Vs. Mobile Applications</h1>
    <p class="date">October 20th, 2019</p>
    <P class="author">By Joshua Davenport</P>
    <p>The year is 2019. If you are reading this article, there is a fairly good chance you’re doing so on a mobile device such as a tablet or smartphone. If so, I have a curious question for you: Are you reading this on a mobile app such as Canvas? Or are you viewing it on a responsive website through a browser such as Safari or Chrome? How you came to read this article may be the determining factor on which platform you’re currently using.</p>
    <p>But there’s another side to why you are (virtually) where you are. Every company with a web presence needs to make a few informed decisions about HOW they want to reach their audience.  They can decide to make their website responsive, they can develop a web application, or they can do both. “Both, obviously” is the knee-jerk response most would come up with, but it’s not quite so simple. There are many factors that developers must consider when waging this question. In this article we will compare the pros and cons of both responsive websites and mobile applications.</p>
    <h2>Responsive Websites</h2>
    <p>Responsive websites are websites that automatically adjust their formatting to fit the various display sizes and aspect ratios.</p>
    <h3>Pros:</h3>
    <p>For an avid developer, making a website responsive is a fairly surmountable task. A few alterations to the CSS and you’re up and running, making this option rather cost effective. According to /sociallocker of  thinkmobiles.com, responsive websites are easy for updating, supporting, and bug fixing,  “On opposite to mobile apps, a user doesn’t have to install the new version to see the enhancements on the website. For the most part, users don’t even notice the process of updating. They can simply enjoy the renewed product. At the same time, it is easier and cheaper for an owner to update one website. (/sociallocker)”</p>
    <h3>Cons:</h3>
    <p>Responsive websites are not nearly as fast as mobile applications. Kris from smashstack.com says “It takes a long time to navigate to a mobile site through a phone’s browser when compared with the convenience of an app. (Kris)”</p>
    <p>Responsive websites may be cheaper to create and maintain, “However responsive website can’t satisfy all the needs and you still have to pay for domain and hosting. (/sociallocker)”</p>
    <h2>Mobile Applications</h2>
    <p>As described by Priya Viswanathan of Lifewire.com, “Mobile applications are software programs developed for mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets. They turn mobile devices into miniature powerhouses of function and fun. (Viswanathan)”</p>
    <h3>Pros:</h3>
    <p>Mobile apps have several legs up over responsive websites, one of which is functionality. “Apps feature greater functionality than mobile-oriented sites can allow due to the way each is custom built into the device’s OS. This means that apps can easily integrate with other features and tools in a device as well as support functions that aren’t possible with web-based HTML5. (Kris)”</p>
    <p>Another perk of mobile apps is faster performance. “ Mobile apps are designed top to bottom with efficiency in mind. Apps usually have faster loading times than web pages as they aren’t cluttered with unnecessary site elements. The user experience is optimized. (Kris)”</p>
    <h3>Cons:</h3>
    <p>Mobile apps offer a lot of form, function, and speed; but they do not come without significant cost. A run-of-the-mill developer usually does not have what it takes to develop an adequate mobile app. Mobile app developers require more training and need to produce several versions of the same product to allow them to be used on a variety of operating systems. An app developed of iOS is not compatible on an Android device. </p>
    <p>Mobile app development is also less timely. “Most businesses pay top dollar for native app development that takes longer than building a mobile site. (Kris)”</p>
    <h3>Conclusion:</h3>
    <p>Whether you decide to spend the resources needed for developing a mobile app to reach your audience depends on what you need it to do. If you're company is smaller with a website that is merely informative, then the time and money necessary to put into mobile app development might not be worth it to you. However, it is my opinion that if your are trying to grow your company, reaching as many users as possible should always be at the forefront of your plan, and therefore taking the financial “hit” is likely worth it in the long run. </p>
