    <h1>Why Flexbox</h1>

    <p>Before the Flexbox module was introduced in July of 2009 we had 4 main layout modes to work with: Block layout for sections in a webpage, Inline for text, Table for 2D table data, and Positioned for explicit positioning of an element. Flexbox Layout Module makes it easier to design flexible and responsive layouts by eliminating the need for floats or positioning. But there are a number of additional reasons to make the switch to Flexbox when designing your website. We’ll cover a few here.</p>
    <p>With the exception of Internet Explorer 10 and below (Which even Microsoft says is no longer relevant), Flexbox is strongly supported on all major browsers. This level of support means that there are very few pitfalls to come across when designing websites across multiple browsers.</p>
    <p>Flexbox offers roughly 48 new potential values within their 12 new properties. Wrapping your head around all of these at once can make for a daunting learning experience. The good news is that there are just 3 basic properties that cover about 95% of what you need to become comfortable with Flexbox. The first, Display, sets the elements as inline or block flexbox container elements. Justify-content controls the horizontal alignment of items within the flex container, while align-items controls handles the vertical alignment.</p>
    <p>Now the display, justify-content, and align-items properties alone make flexbox worthwhile, but they all pale in comparison to its crowning jewel; the one-two punch of the justify-content/align-items combo allows you to EASILY center your elements. I’ll give you a moment to let that sink in… I KNOW! RIGHT?! As Billy Williams from distinction.co.uk puts it “Quite simply, Flexbox is an absolute dream to center elements in comparison to the usual CSS techniques (Williams)”. And I couldn’t agree more.</p>

    <p>Now isn’t that a thing of elegance and beauty?</p>
